This is a project I work on every year for march madness bracket pools. It scrapes KenPom, then Yahoo sports user pick data for the tournament. The algorithm then finds the teams with the biggest advantages in winning probabilities for each round via KenPom compared to the percentage of people picking them. It compiles this data and several stats of my own creation into a csv file. This should be applicable for years to come, with adjustments made for web scraping.
